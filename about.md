## Me, and this project
I am Chi Gao 高驰, an associate at the Regulatory Associate Project (RAP). 
In my day job, I analyze energy policies in China, especially those of the 
electricity sector. The end products are often served to policymakers and 
stakeholders who are well-versed in the energy sector. To complement my 
day job and to push myself to learn, I created this public-facing website 
whose main audience are you folks on the internet, who are interested to 
learn more about energy policies that are power our world (got it? energy 
policies are *powering* our world, you got it right? I know you got it). 
I will explore a diverse set of delivery methods, so some of the posts will 
get experimental. Anyway, let me know what you want me to cover, and I will 
happy dive into the rabbit hole for you, and also for myself. 

I will try to write an article at least every two weeks, unless I am in the 
rabbit hole way too deep. 

Just in case you are wondering, *Neng* 能 in Chinese means "able", but more 
importantly, the phrase *neng yuan* 能源 means energy -- hence the title.
